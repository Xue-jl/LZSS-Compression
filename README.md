# LZSS-Compression
An efficient lossless data compression algorithm implementation

## Description
Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski (LZSS) algorithm is the variation of Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) algorithm, which optimizes space storage for binary numbers. LZSS algorithm is a prefix-free algorithm which means there're no common prefix for all code words.

LZSS algorithm is a ***sliding window*** based algorithm. It includes the lookup buffer size (*the size after current cursor*) and dictionary size (*the size before current cursor*)

LZSS algorithm can be used in many applications, such as *gzip*, *PKZIP* etc.

The project is the implementation includes:
1. **encoder** : encode(compress) data into binary number
2. **decoder** : decode(unzip) binary number to data

## Compliation

### Encoder
```
python3 lzss_encoder.py <inputfile> <D> <B>
```
D is the dictionary size, B is the buffer size.
For example, assuming the Sliding window size is 10, and D = 6, B = 4.

The input file can be tested from the file generated by decoder `output_lzss_decoder.txt`

### Decoder
```
pyhton3 lzss_decoder.py <inputfile>
```
The input file can be tested by the file generated from encoder `output_lzss_encoder.txt`
